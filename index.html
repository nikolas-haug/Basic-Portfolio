                        I am a student currently enrolled in the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp program. Before enrolling in the course, I spent nearly a year learning to code on my own. I discovered many online resources during this time, including video classes, books, interactive tutoring, and guidance and instruction from several of my savy friends. I hope that my prior knowledge, although limited, will help me succeed in the university program,and I look forward to finding work in an entirely new field upon its completion.

                        I am very familiar with HTML and CSS, and have spent a lot of time learning about and working with JavaScript. I have also spent some time learning Node.js and have built a few simple Express apps. I am hoping that a full stack flex program will round out my skills and allow me to do the work I intend to do.

                        Aside from working with code, I also have a background in English literature and French. I have worked as an ESL/ELL instructor in Minneapolis and in France, and remotely online via Skype. I am an avid reader and write a lot. I also play music and enjoy writing that too. I have lived in many places around the world and enjoy traveling. I hope that my newly earned skills as a coder will contribute to, and complement my future endeavors.
